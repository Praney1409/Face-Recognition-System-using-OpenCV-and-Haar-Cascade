# Face-Recognition-System-using-OpenCV-and-Haar-Cascade
The Face Recognition System using OpenCV and Haar Cascade is an artificial intelligence-based project that identifies and verifies human faces through image processing. It uses a webcam to capture faces, stores them in a dataset, trains a model using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm, and recognizes faces in real time.
